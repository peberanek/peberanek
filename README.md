# Hi, I'm Petr.

I'm interested in generative AI, automation, personal finance, and [Behavior Design](https://behaviordesign.info/) - specifically the [Tiny Habits](https://tinyhabits.com/) method.

I'm currently exploring practical use and impact of generative AI at [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html). Before that, I was a software quality engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/).

Feel free to check out my [personal website](https://peberanek.github.io/).

Thanks for reading.
